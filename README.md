# CLIPMesh

This is an unofficial implementation of CLIPMesh (https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13333), a method for text2mesh using CLIP.

The results generated using this repo are currently hit-or-miss - for the example prompts shown in the paper and on the website, some are significantly worse than the results shown, but some are comparable. Final mesh quality is not great but it seems to be comparable to Figure 3(i) and (j) in the paper. If you have any suggestions or find any particularly good hyperparameters feel free to open an issue or PR and I'll gladly merge them in.

## Install

```sh
# Clone recursively
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:cpacker/CLIPMesh.git
cd CLIPMesh

# Setup pytorch and cudatoolkit using conda
conda create -n clipmesh-py37 python=3.7
conda activate clipmesh-py37
conda install pytorch==1.11.0 torchvision==0.12.0 cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch

# Install the rest of the deps
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Example with a prompt from the paper that works well:

```sh
python main_sphere.py --path=configs/improved.yaml --text "a matte painting of a bonsai tree; trending on artstation"
```

Example with a prompt from the paper that is significantly worse:

```sh
python main_sphere.py --path=configs/improved.yaml --text "a red chair"
```

Note that config file `configs/arxiv.yaml` intends to mimic the algorithm described in the paper as closely as possibly (there currently is no official public implementation), while `configs/improved.yaml` has a handful of changes that seem to improve performance on the example prompts.
